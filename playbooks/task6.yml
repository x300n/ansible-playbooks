#Create a playbook that uses the vault file to achieve the following:

#    Users whose user ID starts with 1 should be created on servers in the webservers host group. User password should be used from the user_password variable.
#    Users whose user ID starts with 2 should be created on servers in the database host group. User password should be used from the user_password variable.
#    All users should be members of a supplementary group wheel.
#    Shell should be set to /bin/bash for all users.
#    Account passwords should use the SHA512 hash format.
#    Each user should have an SSH key uploaded 

#After running the playbook, users should be able to SSH into their respective servers without passwords.
